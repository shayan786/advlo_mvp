      Advlo Inc. (“Advlo, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure or personal information we receive from users of www.advlo.com (the “Site”) or through the Service. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service. We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your Advlo Account) or by means of a notice via the Service prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in the Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (at www.advlo.com).
    %p
      As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally. 

    %h4 INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
    %p
      Your information may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Advlo transfers personal information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
    %h4 INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
    %p
      Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content (collectively, the “Service”), to administer your use of the Service and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Service. 
    %h4 PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
    %p
      When your register with Advlo through the Service and become a User and when you choose to become a Host, post an Adventure or book an Adventure we will ask you for personally identifiable information.  This refers to information about you that can be used to contract or identify you (“Identity Information”). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your e-mail  address, name, home postal address, bank information, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. In order to process some of your transactions through the Service, we may also ask for your credit card number and other billing information (“Billing Information”). Billing Information and Identity Information together will be referred to as “Personal Information”. If the address associated with an Adventure listing you post matches that of your credit card billing address, that address would be consider Identity Information. Some Personal Information may be required, like your name and email address, and other Personal Information may be optional, however, Hosts must either provide their bank account information or PayPal email address in order to receive payments from Advlo. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.

    %p
      We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join the Service. You can register to join via the Service by completing the required forms.

    %p
      You may also be permitted to register to join by logging into the online accounts you may have with third party service providers (“Social Networking Services”); each such account, a “Third Party Account”, via the Service as described below. As part of the functionality of the Service, you may link your Advlo Account with Third Party Accounts, by either (a) providing your Third Party Account login information to Advlo through the Service; or (b) allowing Advlo to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Advlo and/or grant Advlo access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Parry Account and without obligating Advlo to pay any fees or making Advlo subject to any usage limitation imposed by the applicable Social Networking Services. If you decide to register by logging into a Third Party Account via the Service, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the applicable Social Networking Service (such as your “name”, email address, profile picture, names of Social Networking Service friends, other information you made publicly available via the applicable Social Networking Service and/or other information you authorize Advlo to access by authorizing the Social Networking Service to provide such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your Advlo Account and Advlo Profile Page. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy setting that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the Social Networking Service and authorized by you) the information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your Advlo Account on the Service. If there is information about your “friends” or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those “friends” or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable Social Networking Service.
      %p
        We may also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Advlo Account profile (ex: without limitation, zip code, and individual preferences or demographic information) (“Non-Identifying Information”).
      %p
        We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries. 
      %p
        Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your demographic information). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Advlo Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how the Service is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions. 
      %p
        We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Advlo updates, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instruction provided in any of the communications or contact us as detailed in the “Changing or Deleting Information” section, below. Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications. 
      %h4 LOG DATA
      %p
        When you visit the Service, whether as a Member or a non-registered users just browsing (any of these, an “Advlo User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpages you were visiting before you came to the Services, pages of the Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on the Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service’s technical administration, to increase the Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Service to our visitors’ and users’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to and users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information. Cookies, like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. Third party advertisers on the Service may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portion of the Service or all functionality of the Service.
      %h4 WEB BEACONS
      %p
        Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs), which would be used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how the Service is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This would allow us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communication and marketing campaigns.
      %h4 SENDING MESSAGES VIA AN ADVLO ACCOUNT
      %p
        As part of the Service, Advlo Users may communicate with Advlo Users through the Service. Where Advlo Users have selected the option of adding an email address to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template may be sent from Advlo to those email addresses on their behalf. If so, such email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee.
      %h4 PHISHING
      %p
        Identity theft and the practice currently known as “Phishing” are of great concern to Advlo. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.

You can review and make changes to your Profile Information at any time. 
      %h4 ADVENTURE LISTINGS
      %p
        If you post an Adventure Listing, we may publish that Adventure publicly via the Service. We may also display the geographical location of your Adventure in the form of a map so that potential Travelers can see the general area and neighborhood of your Adventure, but the actual street address will not be disclosed (unless the street address was uploaded by the users themselves). If you request to make a booking via the Service, Advlo may share the following information about you with the applicable Host: your name (first name and last initial) and e-mail address. All of this information, along with the requested date, time and optional message, will enable the Host to decide whether to accept or decline the Traveler’s requested booking. When a Host confirms or accepts a booking we may share pieces of the Host’s Identity Information, including, but not limited to, name, the Adventure’s address, and e-mail address, with the applicable Traveler selected by the Host and we may share pieces of the Traveler’s Identity Information with the Host, including, but not limited to, name and e-mail address, so that the Traveler and Host may contact one another directly. In no event is a Traveler’s Billing Information shared with a Host or any other Advlo User.
